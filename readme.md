This is my website submission for the IEEE post. 

I decided to make a webiste on the festival of diwali which tells people what is it about as well as the rules and possible questions they may have about the festival.

This website comprises of 3 pages and uses HTML,CSS,JS.

Why dont you try and click the title(index page) or the buttons(in rules page). ;)
